    <h2>Welcome to Pete's Cakes de Cups!</h2>
    <p>Ya see, one day pete had a dream. A dream that involved cupcakes...lots of 'em.
      Pete got a hankerin' for cupcakes that were more than just frosting
      on top of cake. So he took his fancy cordon bleu training and began
      to endlessly annoy his family and friends until they tried his newest
      gourment concoctions and they realized <em>HEY...these are pretty good!</em>
      The rest is history! ...Well history and a lot of shady fundraising!
