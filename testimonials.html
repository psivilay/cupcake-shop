    <p><em>I found the meaning of life in a cupcake. It was amazing. And expensive.
      And also over too soon. 10/10 would cake again</em>. -Bobby</p>

    <p><em>I lost my marriage over these cupcakes. I am lonely. But not hungry at least.</em> -Sally</p>

    <p><em>I was going to get a dozen for my girlfriend's birthday...Let's just
    say ex-girlfriend now. But I ain't even mad bro. Cupcakes-4-lyfe!</em>-Georgie</p>
